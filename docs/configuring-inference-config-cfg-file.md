An example and Explaination of the `agentic-config.cfg` file:
`````

key_file=/path/to/key/file.pem

deploy_genai_gateway=on
deploy_observability=on

Make sure to update the values in the agentic-config.cfg file according to your requirements before running the Intel Agentic AI Stack.


>
> - If `deploy_kubernetes_fresh` is set to `on`, a fresh Kubernetes cluster will be initialized as per the deployment configuration.
> - If `deploy_ingress_controller` is set to `on`, ingress controller will be configured to route external traffic to the cluster
> - If `deploy_genai_gateway` is set to `on`, the GenAI Gateway will be deployed.
> - If `deploy_observability` is set to `on`, the observability stack will be deployed for monitoring.
> - If `deploy_llm_models` is set to `on`, the selected models will be deployed for inferencing
> - The `cert_file` and `key_file` paths should be set according to the instructions for generating certificates for development and production environments, as documented.
> - The `models` value corresponds to the pre-validated LLM models listed in the documentation.
> - The `hugging_face_token` is the token used for pulling LLM models from Hugging Face. 
> - If `deploy_llm_models` is set to `off`, the `hugging_face_token` value will be ignored.
> - The `cpu_or_gpu` value specifies whether to deploy models for CPU or Intel® AI Accelerator.
> - If `deploy_redis` is set to `on` , Redis will be deployed which is the default memory backend, giving agents persistent session state, semantic search over past interactions, and cross-request continuity
> - If `deploy_coding_agent` is set to `on` , This is the sample usecase which deploys coding agent usecase on the Agentic Stack deployed.
